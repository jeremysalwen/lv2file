Description: Command-line program to apply LV2 effects to audio files
 lv2file is a simple program which you can use to apply LV2 effects to your
 audio files without much hassle.
 .
 Possible use cases of lv2file are:
  * Apply an effect without having to open a GUI or start a project.
  * Apply effects to a large number of files, or in an automated manner.
  * You need a deterministic environment to debug a plugin you are developing.
  * Command-line only audio processing.
 .
 lv2file does not come with any built-in effects, so you must install other
 packages containing LV2 plugins to use with lv2file.

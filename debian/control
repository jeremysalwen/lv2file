Description: Command-line program to apply LV2 effects to files
 lv2file is a simple program which you can use to apply LV2 effects to your
 audio files without much hassle.
 .
 Possible use cases of lv2file are:
 * Apply an effect without having to open a GUI or start
   a project.
 * Apply effects to a large number of files, or in an
   automated manner.
 * You need a deterministic environment to debug a plugin you are developing.
 * Command-line only audio processing. 
 . 
 lv2file does not come with any built-in effects, so you must install other
 packages containing LV2 plugins to use with lv2file.
